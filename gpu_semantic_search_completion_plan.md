# GPU-Enabled Semantic Search Completion Plan

## Current Status
We have successfully implemented the core infrastructure for GPU-enabled semantic code search:
- ✅ Created GPU embedding provider using Candle and Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B model
- ✅ Implemented Qdrant vector store integration
- ✅ Created semantic search tool for the AI assistant
- ✅ Added settings structure for opt-in configuration
- ✅ Fixed all compilation errors and API compatibility issues
- ✅ Updated documentation to reflect Qwen3-Embed-0.6 model with INT8 quantization
- ✅ Registered SemanticIndexSettings to fix "Property semantic_index is not allowed" error

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Complete SemanticDb Initialization
- Create initialization flow in `semantic_index::init()` that:
  - Checks if semantic_index is enabled in settings
  - Creates GPU embedding provider when gpu_embeddings is enabled
  - Initializes SemanticDb with proper database path
  - Sets SemanticDb as global for access by other components
- Handle graceful fallback when GPU is not available
- Add proper error handling and user notifications

### 2. Implement Project Indexing
- Create background indexing service that:
  - Scans project files on startup
  - Uses tree-sitter for language-aware code parsing
  - Chunks code at semantic boundaries (functions, classes, etc.)
  - Generates embeddings using GPU provider
  - Stores embeddings in Qdrant vector database
- Add progress indicators for indexing status
- Implement incremental indexing for file changes

### 3. Manual Semantic Search UI
- Add new search mode to existing search interface:
  - Add "Semantic" option alongside "Text" and "Regex" search modes
  - Create natural language query input
  - Display results ranked by semantic similarity
- Alternative: Create dedicated semantic search command:
  - Add command palette action "Search: Semantic Search"
  - Open modal with query input and results list
  - Show code snippets with similarity scores

### 4. Integration Points
- Wire up file watcher to update index on file changes
- Add workspace-specific index management
- Implement index cleanup on project close
- Add memory management for large codebases

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- Implement batched embedding generation
- Add caching layer for frequently accessed embeddings
- Optimize Qdrant queries with proper indexing
- Monitor and limit GPU memory usage

### 6. User Experience Enhancements
- Add settings UI for semantic search configuration
- Show indexing status in status bar
- Provide clear error messages for GPU/model issues
- Add telemetry for usage patterns

### 7. Testing and Documentation
- Add integration tests for semantic search workflow
- Create user documentation for the feature
- Add performance benchmarks
- Document troubleshooting steps for common issues

## Technical Debt
- The `vector_store` trait and Qdrant implementation have unused methods that need cleanup
- Consider abstracting the embedding provider to support multiple models
- Evaluate if we need both `chunking` and `chunking_v2` modules

## Future Enhancements
- Support for multiple embedding models
- Cloud-based vector store option for teams
- Semantic code navigation (jump to semantically related code)
- AI-powered code explanations using semantic context
- Cross-project semantic search for monorepos
